# November Gallery Quick Start

### (1) Prepare and Upload your Images

**You can choose to upload your images either using the "Gallery" page in the October back-end, or you can use the built-in Media Manager**. In either case, we highly recommend resizing your images before uploading them to your site. If you are going to use the Media Manager, then you may also want to create folders for your images. 

Although you can use any folder structure that you'd like, we recommend that you create a "root" folder and create separate folders underneath it to store your albums. You can optionally create separate "root" folders to store your images, videos, and blog pictures. Avoid using spaces or special characters in your folder names. Your folder structure may look like this:

- my_galleries
	- my_travels
		- 2018-argentina
		- 2015-vietnam
		- 2010-hungary
	- cat_pictures
	- awesome_vacuum_cleaners

Next, prepare your pictures for display on the WWW. Make sure that your photos are in a format that web browsers understand, such as .jpg or .png, or .gif (the latter is more suitable for graphics with fewer colors and geometric lines, such as charts or icons).

Although the plugin will automatically generate thumbnails of your pictures, the full-size images will be displayed as-is. Therefore, it's also a good idea to resize all of your pictures before uploading them to the gallery. A plethora of free options exist to help you with that, we â™¥ [FastStone Image Viewer](https://www.faststone.org) (Windows), [Fast Image Resizer](https://adionsoft.net/) (Windows), and [Image Resizer for Windows](http://www.bricelam.net/ImageResizer/). There are great options out there for Mac as well.

A typical screen resolution nowadays is around 1920 x 1680 pixels - so if you're looking to allow your users to see your pictures in top quality full-screen, then resize them to fit within these constraints.

Finally, upload your pictures using the "Gallery" admin area, or through the October Media manager into the folders you created earlier.

### (2) Configure The Plugin
Well, you are already looking at the plugin settings page. Things to look out for:

 - `Settings` Tab: Select the folder that you created your galleries under from the Base Media Folder drop-down, you can also select a default layout for your galleries. 
- `Thumbnails` Tab: It is recommended to use the image resizer to automatically generate thumbnails of your pictures. For this, make sure that the "Use Image Resizer" option is ON on the Thumbnails plugin configuration tab. You can also set either the width or the height for your thumbnails here.
- `Advanced` Tab: *Inject UniteGallery Assets* should probably be on. If your theme already includes jQuery, then you can set *Inject jQuery* to OFF.

### (3) Drop the Plugin Onto your CMS Page(s)

The plugin provides four components that you can drop onto your CMS Pages/Partials/Layouts, it also works as a "Snippet" in static pages. Each option on the component inspector comes with (i) hints, so you should have no trouble understanding how to use it. Please see the *Documentation* tab for a description of each component option.

## Components

### The Embedded Gallery Component
 
This gallery makes use of UniteGallery JS. Use it to show a gallery of thumbnails, or a gallery "embedded" into your page, with optional full-screen (lightbox-style) viewing.

> Hint: Use the Embedded Gallery for fix-size galleries or for showing clickable thumbnails arranged as tiles

Several gallery layouts are available:

#### Tiles

This gallery displays your images as clickable "tiles" that open a popup lightbox. It really looks best if your images have differing dimensions, some tall, some landscape, some square, etc. You can choose from four tile layouts: Columns, Justified, Nested, and Grid.

#### Carousel

This gallery displays your images in a row that (optionally) scrolls by itself.

#### Combined

This gallery combines a large image with a row of thumbnails. It works best if your images are relatively small and have the same dimensions. There are three themes available: Normal, Compact, and Grid.

#### Slider

This gallery is similar to the "Combined" gallery without a strip of thumbnails.

### The Swiper Component

This makes use of Swiper. Use it to create a modern, responsive "swiper" that can be controlled easily from any device. Note that you can control any of the galleries by touch (or click-and-swipe using a mouse). Various transitions are available: "fade", "slide", "flip", "cube", etc..

> Hint: The Swiper Component is really geared towards responsive galleries because by default it fills whatever container it is in. 

### The Popup Lightbox Component

This makes use of a custom UniteGallery JS theme. Use it to create a pop-up lightbox of images that can be opened from a link or button (or any other clickable component) on the page. Two styles are available: "Wide" and "Compact".

### The Video Gallery Component

Again, this makes use of UniteGallery JS. Use it to display videos inline. You can choose to upload your videos to your website or to show videos hosted on YouTube/Vimeo/Wistia.

### Image List Only Component

Well, we probably could have given this component a better name. This component only loads the list of image files into a page variable, without rendering a gallery. Use this if you wish to write your own code for displaying the images, or if you wish to make use of some other JS library to render them.
